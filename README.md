# Algorithm Solutions

## Introduction
This repository contains my personal solutions to algorithmic problems from AlgoExpert. Each solution is organized into its own folder, complete with the problem description and my approach to solving it.

## Repository Structure
- Each folder in this repository represents a specific algorithmic problem.
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - `README.md`: Contains the problem statement, its complexity, and any relevant notes.
  - `solution.*`: The file with the actual solution code. The file extension depends on the programming language used (e.g., `.py` for Python, `.js` for JavaScript).

## Disclaimer
These solutions are meant for educational purposes and to demonstrate problem-solving approaches. Please use these solutions responsibly and do not copy them directly for any assessments or job interview tasks.

## Contributing
While this is a personal repository, suggestions and improvements are welcome. Please feel free to submit a pull request or an issue if you have any improvements or find any bugs in the solutions.
