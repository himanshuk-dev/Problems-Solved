# Add Binary Strings
# two binary strings: str1, str2
# 1 â‰¤ str1.length , str2.length â‰¤ 500
# str1 and str2 consist of 0 or 1 characters only.
# Any string must not contain leading zeros except the string representing the binary form of 0.
# Examples:
#   str1 = "1"
#   str2 = "1"
#   result: "10"

# Approach
#  Iterate over the two strings in reverse order using two pointers.
#  For each iteration, retreive corresponding digits of the two strings.
#  Sum the retreived digits and carry. Convert the sum to binary and append it to the result.calculate the carry for next iteration.
#  If carry is equal to 1, append it to the result.
#  Reverse the result and return it.
